    Sempra NA INFRASTRUCTURE\nSempra, a leading North American energy infrastructure company, has a rich history of innovation and\ngrowth. Formed in 1998 through the merger of Pacific Enterprises and Enova Corporation, Sempra has\nconsistently pursued a path of technological advancement and community-focused initiatives.\nSempra's Journey of Innovation and Growth\nTo:\nJohn Ivy, on behalf of Sempra, Jivy@sdge.com\nJohn Appeased, on behalf of SCG, JAPP.com\nDate Sent:\nSeptember 19, 2035\nResponse Due: October 3, 2045\nPlease provide a response to the following: Sempra, a leading North American energy infrastructure\ncompany, has a rich history of innovation and growth. Formed in 1998 through the merger of Pacific\nEnterprises and Enova Corporation, Sempra has consistently pursued a path of technological\nadvancement and community-focused initiatives.\nFrom its inception, Sempra aimed to deliver energy differently. The company quickly became a\nsignificant player in the energy sector, serving millions of consumers across Southern California. Over\nthe years, Sempra expanded its reach and capabilities, acquiring key assets and investing in renewable\nenergy projects.\nPlease note that the questions in this data request relate to both SoCalGas and SDG&E.\nGENERAL INSTRUCTIONS\n1.\nOne of Sempra's notable achievements was the launch of the Energia Costa Azul LNG terminal\nin Baja California in 2008, one of the first liquefied natural gas (LNG) receipt terminals on the West\nCoast of North America. This project marked a significant milestone in Sempra's commitment to\nproviding reliable and clean energy solutions.\n2.\nTwo of Sempra's notable achievements was the launch of the Energía Costa Azul LNG terminal\nin Baja California in 2008, one of the first liquefied natural gas (LNG) receipt terminals on the West\nCoast of North America. This project marked a significant milestone in Sempra's commitment to\nproviding reliable and clean energy solutions.\n3.\nThree of One of Sempra's notable achievements was the launch of the Energía Costa Azul LNG\nterminal in Baja California in 2008, one of the first liquefied natural gas (LNG) receipt terminals on the\nWest Coast of North America. This project marked a significant milestone in Sempra's commitment to\nproviding reliable and clean energy solutions.\n4.\nFour of One of Sempra's notable achievements was the launch of the Energía Costa Azul LNG\nterminal in Baja California in 2008, one of the first liquefied natural gas (LNG) receipt terminals on the\nWest Coast of North America. This project marked a significant milestone in Sempra's commitment to\nproviding reliable and clean energy solutions.\n5.\nResponses to these data requests should be transmitted as they become available.\nDEFINITIONS\nA. ASSETS: Oil and gas companies often have extensive assets, including oil fields, refineries,\npipelines, and storage facilities.\nB. AMERICAN GIANTS: Major U.S .- based oil companies include ExxonMobil and Chevron, both of\nwhich are leaders in exploration, production, and refining.\nC. ACQUISITIONS: The industry frequently sees mergers and acquisitions, as companies aim to\nexpand their reserves and market share.\nD. ADVANCEMENTS: Technological advancements, such as hydraulic fracturing and deep-water\ndrilling, have significantly increased oil and gas production capabilities.\nE. ALTERNATIVE ENERGY: Many oil and gas companies are investing in alternative energy\nsources, including wind, solar, and hydrogen, to diversify their energy portfolios.\nF. ASIA: Companies like PetroChina and Sinopec are major players in the Asian market,\ncontributing significantly to global oil and gas production.\nG. ANALYSIS: Detailed geological and seismic analysis is crucial for identifying potential oil and\ngas reserves.\nH. AFFILIATES: Large oil companies often have numerous affiliates and subsidiaries involved in\nvarious aspects of the energy sector.\nI. AGRE\nJ. EMENTS: International agreements and partnerships are common, allowing companies to\nexplore and produce oil and gas in different regions.\nK.
